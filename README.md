# Excel-Forensic-Optimizer
The "Excel Forensic Pro" is a high-performance diagnostic utility designed to identify structural bloat, security risks, and performance bottlenecks within Microsoft Excel workbooks. It utilizes a background "COM (Component Object Model) Automation Engine" to perform deep-tissue scans without altering the original file data.
These are all the version which is going to be developed with bugs as well as resolving issues in it...
we are working on it and make it better day by day but at the point this is the final executable file which you can use it...
If you want python file which you want to upgrade it then you may use Excel Forensic Optimizer v10.8.py where you may find all the code....
The final Executable file will be in the dist/Excel Forensic Optimizer v10.8.exe
