# Excel-Forensic-Optimizer
The "Excel Forensic Pro" is a high-performance diagnostic utility designed to identify structural bloat, security risks, and performance bottlenecks within Microsoft Excel workbooks. It utilizes a background "COM (Component Object Model) Automation Engine" to perform deep-tissue scans without altering the original file data.<br><br>
These are all the version which is going to be developed having some bugs as well as error which we resolves with working with it...<br><br>
we are working on it and make it better day by day but at the point this is the final executable file which you can use it...<br><br>
If you want python file which you want to use it and develop according to your own need then you may use Excel Forensic Optimizer v10.8.py where you may find all the code....<br><br>
